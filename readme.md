### CV

My professional, digital CV designed in html, css, js with a focus on utilizing the component based architecutre of bootstrap. The idea is to create a professional resume page that can be added to a personal site.

#### What is it?

This is a cv built fully in bootstrap, with extra css, js and jquery built in to enhance the functionality, to make it dynamic, responsive and animated.

#### Project purposes

Much like my [Nomadica](https://github.com/ShaAnder/Nomadica_Landing_Page/tree/main) project, this was originally a follow along project that was designed to increase bootstrap knowledge and showcase that we can use the frame work well.

However also much like nomadica i did not want to follow along with the project and just replicate what the tutor was doing. To that end I designed and built the entire page from the ground up utilizing my own knowledge and skills while following along with the lesson structure to keep to pace.

### FEATURES

This landing page features a fully responsive layout and design, incorporating dynaamic and animated fields. It allows quick navigation to segments as well as contact fields.

#### Future features

As this is effectively my cv I want this to be able to represent me to the fullest, it will be part of a full (full stack) website i create and will be the first point of contact for recruiters to reach me. Other features will include links to active projects ect.

### DEVELOPMENT

#### Languages

This website was created using HTML CSS JS and jquery

#### Tools

The site used Bootstrap frameworks

### CREDITS AND ATTRIBUTION

All work is designed by me with minimal bootstrap templates for inspiration
